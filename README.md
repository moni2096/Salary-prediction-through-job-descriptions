# Salary prediction through job descriptions
## Description
Predicting salary of an employee is an importanat aspect for business's HR and talent function. The aim of this project is to build a predictive analysis application in python that can be used to predict the salaries of an employee.

## Goal
The analysis is aimed to outcome every step in the process of predicting salary of an employee from loading data and performing EDA to deploy and automate pipeline by builduing machine learning model.

## Dataset
The analysis is carried out on 112 mb dataset which consists of features mentioned below:
**jobID**: The specific Id assigned to each role.

**companyID**: The specific Id assigned to company in each categories.

**degree**: The degree which applicant possess while applying for a particular job or woking at a particular role in a company.

**major**: Major related to the degrees possessed by the applicant.

**industry**: Industry that given individual works in. Popular once are Tech, Finance, Oil.

**yearsOfExperience**: The number of years of experience that an applicant possess.

**milesFromMetropolis** : Distance of the location from the Metropolis.

**salary** : Salary of the job. The values are given in 1000s of the actual value.
